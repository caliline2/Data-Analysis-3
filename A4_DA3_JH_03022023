# 1. Introduction

This paper explores data from online portal Costar and Radius that store Lease Comps for real estate. This exercise attempts to create a simplified model to explain the impact of COVID-19 on office rent levels in London. The model control for other determinants, particularly the distance from the city center,highest floor of the deal, leased square feet, and lease term. For this purpose, we use a hedonic regression model (OLS) of net rent using dummy variables for years, days of the weak, type of lease, and months and controlling for the aforementioned variables. The original 140,000 data entries from the CoStar and Radius databases covers the period from 1.1.1980 to 21.4.2022. The data is heterogeneous and incomplete. For the purpose of this paper, several variables are omitted, and the overall model is simplified to include key information and was heavily reduced to 55k observations to use only complete entries. The effect of market fundamentals is captured by years (different crisis) and COVID-19 lockdowns starting on the 26.3.2020 in the UK.

# 2. Data: 

## Present the dataset, describe key features

I have managed to collect full data for 1 countries for 34 years - 1980 and 2022. Data are missing for earlier years but also more recent years because of confidientialy but also because of COVID-19 crisis. There are usually fewer deals during crises.

### Data Challenges
The theoretical and empirical literature suggest that multicollinearity may be present as the higher floors and larger floorplates are usually constructed and leased in the city centres. Additional multicollinearity issues are linked with the timeline, such as more high-rise properties being available on the market more recently as they were being progressively constructed.


# Model

# 3. Model:

## OLS Regression Hedonic model 

First I have conducted a basic linear regression using the original variables (not the aggregate). The R-squared was ~0.23 which means it is able to capture some variance but it is not a perfect fit.

# Conclusion

In the light of the current events and the COVID-19 pandemic, many claimed the office rents decreased. This quick exercise confirms the result that indeed when controlling for time COVID-19 did have a negative effect.

The model has a weak explanatory power (R square ~ 0.23) with a decreasing trend over time. The pre-millennium years display higher explanatory power. In the current years the consumers might have become more sophisticated looking for more than just a centrical location.
The distance is one of the core explanatory variables with the largest (negative) coefficient in terms of property variables. In contrast, the exact dates of lockdowns do not significantly impact rents but rather the number of market transactions. Nonetheless, the COVID-years do seem to have an effect on number of transactions and the rent level.

The limitations of this research include a limited dataset. The model has to be simplified due to the unavailability of new variables and multicollinearity. The model would benefit from further data for property quality, covenant, and location details. On a more positive note, the model does capture that distance is still a significant determinant of rent levels but perhaps not as much as before due to cheaper and faster transport and digitization.
